On weird tricks to managing chores I took my watch off to wash the dishes before I left to go do something else for a second It was coding, which I am glad I am doing I was going to take a break with some xbox but then I realized I wanted to wear my watch So I went to the kitchen and did the dishes so I could wear my watch Does that make sense Sacrifice something for a reward you will get in the future after some work Something simple but good for something small and easy at first but that small and easy you are doing that simple and good for, it has still got to be worthy Value in progression towards something in the long term It is hard to care about the long term, it really fucking is But the short term is what I live in I can organize these thoughts to flow in regular patterns with regular habits That small and good something is a reward that equires an initiatory sacrifice that will be regained in some kind of way It has got to be connected somehow
